## To Github Copilot: can you write testing for my project?

Below are my requirements:

- can pdf file can be uploaded especially via API (using tempfile please)
   - with metadata filled in
   - without metadata filled in

- can folder be created?
- duplicate folders cannot be created in backend (in case insensitive mode)
- duplicate files cannot be created in backend (even in different folders and case-insensitive)

- raising errors to user when he / she wants to create duplicate folders (in case insensitive mode)
- raising errors when user want to create duplicate files (even in different folders and case insensitive)


Please plan what framework you're going to use for these tests, because we're going to test mix of python and javascript...
